# Project 4: Build It Bigger

Build and test a joke telling app with a free ad-supported version and a paid version. As a bonus, deploy a Google Cloud Messaging backend to supply the jokes.

# Features

The finished app consist of four modules:

  *  A Java library that provides jokes
  *  A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
  *  An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
  *  An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display
